Puzzleboxes! The name says it all!

Puzzleboxes are little modular containers you can link together like a puzzle to store little parts or trinkets or whatever else will fit. I originally designed them as a means of organizing the nozzles for my 3D printer that could grow as I got more sizes and kinds.

The design has a few parameters to tweak too. You can even customize what is written on the top of the lid! You will probably have to do some playing around with the font and size in order to get it to fit though. Height can also be adjusted. Other things like the way the round ends of the puzzle piece are done can be tweaked too but that will make them incompatible with the rest of the old boxes.

Have fun!
